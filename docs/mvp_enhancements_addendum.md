## üí° Implementation Notes

### Start Small
Begin with enhancements that provide immediate value with minimal complexity. Focus on reliability and robustness before adding sophisticated features.

### Measure Everything
Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring before adding complex features. You need to understand how the current system performs before optimizing it.

### User Feedback
If building for others, gather user feedback early and often. Prioritize features that solve real problems over technically interesting but unused features.

### Technical Debt
Balance new feature development with refactoring and code quality improvements. Technical debt compounds quickly in financial systems.

### Testing Strategy
Implement comprehensive testing for all enhancements. Financial systems require higher reliability standards than typical software applications.

Remember: The goal is to build a robust, profitable trading system, not to implement every possible feature. Focus on enhancements that directly contribute to better risk-adjusted returns.
