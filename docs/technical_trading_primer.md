# Technical Trading Primer for RapidTrader

Essential technical analysis concepts and implementations used in the RapidTrader system.

## 📈 Overview

Technical analysis is the study of price and volume patterns to forecast future price movements. RapidTrader uses several key technical indicators to generate trading signals.

## 🔧 Core Technical Indicators

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

#### Definition
The Simple Moving Average is the arithmetic mean of closing prices over a specified number of periods.

#### Formula
```
SMA(n) = (P1 + P2 + ... + Pn) / n
```
Where:
- P1, P2, ..., Pn = Closing prices for the last n periods
- n = Number of periods (lookback window)

#### Implementation
```python
def sma(series: pd.Series, n: int) -> pd.Series:
    """Calculate Simple Moving Average."""
    return series.rolling(window=n, min_periods=n).mean()
```

#### Trading Applications
- **Trend Identification**: Price above SMA = uptrend, below = downtrend
- **Support/Resistance**: SMA acts as dynamic support/resistance level
- **Crossover Signals**: Fast SMA crossing above/below slow SMA
- **Market Filter**: SPY above 200-day SMA = bull market

#### Common Periods
- **20-day SMA**: Short-term trend (1 month)
- **50-day SMA**: Medium-term trend (2.5 months)
- **200-day SMA**: Long-term trend (10 months)

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

#### Definition
RSI measures the speed and magnitude of price changes to identify overbought and oversold conditions.

#### Formula (Wilder's Method)
```
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Average Gain = (Previous Average Gain × 13 + Current Gain) / 14
Average Loss = (Previous Average Loss × 13 + Current Loss) / 14
```

#### Implementation
```python
def rsi_wilder(close: pd.Series, window: int = 14) -> pd.Series:
    """Calculate RSI using Wilder's smoothing method."""
    delta = close.diff()
    gain = delta.where(delta > 0, 0)
    loss = -delta.where(delta < 0, 0)
    
    # First calculation uses simple average
    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=window, min_periods=window).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=window, min_periods=window).mean()
    
    # Subsequent calculations use Wilder's smoothing
    for i in range(window, len(gain)):
        avg_gain.iloc[i] = (avg_gain.iloc[i-1] * (window-1) + gain.iloc[i]) / window
        avg_loss.iloc[i] = (avg_loss.iloc[i-1] * (window-1) + loss.iloc[i]) / window
    
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi
```

#### Trading Applications
- **Overbought**: RSI > 70 (consider selling)
- **Oversold**: RSI < 30 (consider buying)
- **Divergence**: Price makes new high/low but RSI doesn't confirm
- **Momentum**: Rising RSI = increasing momentum

#### Interpretation Levels
- **RSI > 80**: Extremely overbought
- **RSI 70-80**: Overbought zone
- **RSI 30-70**: Normal range
- **RSI 20-30**: Oversold zone
- **RSI < 20**: Extremely oversold

### Average True Range (ATR)

#### Definition
ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average of true ranges over a specified period.

#### Formula
```
True Range = MAX(
    High - Low,
    ABS(High - Previous Close),
    ABS(Low - Previous Close)
)

ATR = Average of True Range over n periods
```

#### Implementation
```python
def atr(high: pd.Series, low: pd.Series, close: pd.Series, n: int = 14) -> pd.Series:
    """Calculate Average True Range."""
    prev_close = close.shift(1)
    tr1 = high - low
    tr2 = abs(high - prev_close)
    tr3 = abs(low - prev_close)
    
    true_range = pd.concat([tr1, tr2, tr3], axis=1).max(axis=1)
    return true_range.rolling(window=n, min_periods=n).mean()
```

#### Trading Applications
- **Position Sizing**: Use ATR to determine position size based on volatility
- **Stop Losses**: Set stops at multiple of ATR (e.g., 3x ATR)
- **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trading during extremely low/high volatility
- **Breakout Confirmation**: High ATR confirms genuine breakouts

#### Volatility Interpretation
- **High ATR**: Increased volatility, wider stops needed
- **Low ATR**: Decreased volatility, tighter stops possible
- **Rising ATR**: Volatility expanding
- **Falling ATR**: Volatility contracting

## 📊 Trading Strategies

### RSI Mean-Reversion Strategy

#### Concept
Assumes prices revert to their mean after extreme moves. Uses RSI to identify oversold/overbought conditions.

#### Entry Rules
- **Buy Signal**: RSI < 30 (oversold condition)
- **Sell Signal**: RSI > 70 (overbought condition)
- **Confirmation**: Require 2 out of 3 consecutive days meeting criteria

#### Implementation
```python
def rsi_mean_reversion(df: pd.DataFrame, window: int = 3, min_count: int = 2) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Generate RSI mean-reversion signals with confirmation."""
    rsi = rsi_wilder(df['close'])
    
    # Generate raw signals
    buy_raw = (rsi < 30).astype(int)
    sell_raw = (rsi > 70).astype(int)
    
    # Apply confirmation filter (2 of 3)
    buy_confirmed = buy_raw.rolling(window=window).sum() >= min_count
    sell_confirmed = sell_raw.rolling(window=window).sum() >= min_count
    
    # Generate final signals
    signals = pd.Series('hold', index=df.index)
    signals[buy_confirmed] = 'buy'
    signals[sell_confirmed] = 'sell'
    
    return pd.DataFrame({'signal': signals, 'rsi': rsi})
```

#### Risk Management
- **Stop Loss**: 3x ATR below entry price
- **Position Size**: Based on ATR volatility
- **Market Filter**: Only trade during bull markets (SPY > SMA200)

### SMA Crossover Strategy

#### Concept
Trend-following strategy based on the crossover of two moving averages of different periods.

#### Entry Rules
- **Buy Signal**: Fast SMA crosses above Slow SMA
- **Sell Signal**: Fast SMA crosses below Slow SMA
- **Common Combinations**: 20/50, 50/200

#### Implementation
```python
def sma_crossover(df: pd.DataFrame, fast: int = 20, slow: int = 50) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Generate SMA crossover signals."""
    sma_fast = sma(df['close'], fast)
    sma_slow = sma(df['close'], slow)
    
    # Detect crossovers
    position = pd.Series(index=df.index, dtype=float)
    position[sma_fast > sma_slow] = 1   # Long position
    position[sma_fast < sma_slow] = -1  # Short position
    position = position.fillna(method='ffill').fillna(0)
    
    # Generate signals from position changes
    signals = pd.Series('hold', index=df.index)
    position_change = position.diff()
    signals[position_change > 0] = 'buy'
    signals[position_change < 0] = 'sell'
    
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'signal': signals,
        'sma_fast': sma_fast,
        'sma_slow': sma_slow,
        'position': position
    })
```

#### Advantages
- **Trend Following**: Captures sustained price movements
- **Objective**: Clear, rule-based entry/exit points
- **Versatile**: Works across different timeframes

#### Disadvantages
- **Whipsaws**: False signals during sideways markets
- **Lagging**: Signals come after trend has started
- **Drawdowns**: Can experience extended losing periods

## 🎯 Signal Confirmation System

### 2-of-3 Confirmation

#### Concept
Reduces false signals by requiring multiple confirmations before acting on a signal.

#### Implementation
```python
def signal_confirmation(signals: pd.Series, window: int = 3, min_count: int = 2) -> pd.Series:
    """Apply 2-of-3 confirmation to trading signals."""
    buy_signals = (signals == 'buy').astype(int)
    sell_signals = (signals == 'sell').astype(int)
    
    # Count signals in rolling window
    buy_count = buy_signals.rolling(window=window).sum()
    sell_count = sell_signals.rolling(window=window).sum()
    
    # Apply confirmation threshold
    confirmed_signals = pd.Series('hold', index=signals.index)
    confirmed_signals[buy_count >= min_count] = 'buy'
    confirmed_signals[sell_count >= min_count] = 'sell'
    
    return confirmed_signals
```

#### Benefits
- **Reduces Noise**: Filters out spurious signals
- **Improves Accuracy**: Higher probability of successful trades
- **Risk Reduction**: Fewer false breakouts and whipsaws

### Multi-Strategy Confirmation

#### Concept
Combine signals from multiple strategies to increase confidence.

#### Implementation
```python
def multi_strategy_confirmation(rsi_signals: pd.Series, sma_signals: pd.Series) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Combine RSI and SMA strategy signals."""
    # Score each signal type
    signal_scores = pd.DataFrame({
        'rsi_score': (rsi_signals == 'buy').astype(int) - (rsi_signals == 'sell').astype(int),
        'sma_score': (sma_signals == 'buy').astype(int) - (sma_signals == 'sell').astype(int)
    })
    
    # Calculate combined score
    combined_score = signal_scores.sum(axis=1)
    
    # Generate final signals
    final_signals = pd.Series('hold', index=rsi_signals.index)
    final_signals[combined_score >= 1] = 'buy'   # At least one buy signal
    final_signals[combined_score <= -1] = 'sell' # At least one sell signal
    
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'signal': final_signals,
        'score': combined_score,
        'rsi_signal': rsi_signals,
        'sma_signal': sma_signals
    })
```

## 🛡️ Risk Management Applications

### Position Sizing with ATR

#### Concept
Use ATR to determine appropriate position size based on volatility.

#### Implementation
```python
def atr_position_size(portfolio_value: float, risk_per_trade: float, 
                     entry_price: float, atr_value: float, atr_multiplier: float = 3.0) -> int:
    """Calculate position size based on ATR risk."""
    # Calculate dollar risk per share (stop distance)
    risk_per_share = atr_value * atr_multiplier
    
    # Calculate total dollar risk for the trade
    total_risk = portfolio_value * risk_per_trade
    
    # Calculate number of shares
    shares = int(total_risk / risk_per_share)
    
    # Ensure position doesn't exceed available capital
    max_shares = int(portfolio_value / entry_price)
    
    return min(shares, max_shares)
```

### Market Regime Filter

#### Concept
Use SPY's position relative to its 200-day SMA to determine market regime.

#### Implementation
```python
def market_regime_filter(spy_price: float, spy_sma200: float) -> str:
    """Determine market regime for filtering trades."""
    if spy_price > spy_sma200:
        return 'bull'  # Allow long trades
    else:
        return 'bear'  # Restrict new long positions
```

#### Application
- **Bull Market**: SPY > SMA200, allow new long positions
- **Bear Market**: SPY < SMA200, avoid new long positions
- **Regime Change**: Alert when market regime changes

## 📚 Best Practices

### Indicator Selection
1. **Complementary Indicators**: Use indicators that measure different aspects (trend, momentum, volatility)
2. **Parameter Optimization**: Test different periods to find optimal settings
3. **Market Adaptation**: Adjust parameters for different market conditions
4. **Simplicity**: Start with simple, well-understood indicators

### Signal Generation
1. **Clear Rules**: Define precise entry/exit criteria
2. **Confirmation**: Use multiple confirmations to reduce false signals
3. **Time Consistency**: Apply consistent timeframes across analysis
4. **Backtesting**: Test strategies on historical data before deployment

### Risk Management
1. **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than predetermined amount per trade
2. **Stop Losses**: Always define exit point before entering trade
3. **Diversification**: Spread risk across multiple positions and sectors
4. **Market Conditions**: Adjust strategy based on market regime

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Curve Fitting**: Over-optimizing parameters to historical data
2. **Late Signals**: Acting on lagging indicators without confirmation
3. **Ignoring Risk**: Focusing on returns without considering risk
4. **Emotional Override**: Deviating from systematic rules based on feelings

## 🔍 Advanced Concepts

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- **Higher Timeframe Trend**: Use daily/weekly charts for overall direction
- **Lower Timeframe Entry**: Use hourly charts for precise entry points
- **Alignment**: Trade only when multiple timeframes agree

### Volatility Regimes
- **Low Volatility**: Expect breakouts and trend changes
- **High Volatility**: Expect mean reversion and range-bound trading
- **Volatility Clustering**: High volatility periods tend to cluster

### Market Microstructure
- **Volume Analysis**: Confirm price moves with volume
- **Time of Day**: Consider intraday patterns (opening gaps, closing effects)
- **Day of Week**: Be aware of calendar effects (Monday blues, Friday rallies)

## 📊 Performance Measurement

### Key Metrics
1. **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
2. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Average win divided by average loss
3. **Profit Factor**: Gross profit divided by gross loss
4. **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
5. **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Regular Review**: Analyze strategy performance monthly
2. **Parameter Adjustment**: Fine-tune based on market conditions
3. **New Strategies**: Research and test additional approaches
4. **Risk Assessment**: Monitor and adjust risk parameters
